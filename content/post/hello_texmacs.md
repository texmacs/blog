GNU TeXmacs is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) editing platform 
with special features for scientists. The software aims to provide a unified 
and user friendly framework for editing structured documents with different 
types of content (text, graphics, mathematics, interactive content, etc.). The 
rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to produce 
professionally looking documents, which can either be printed out or presented 
from a laptop.

## Playground

This section serves as a playground to show how Hugo and GNU TeXmacs work 
together.
